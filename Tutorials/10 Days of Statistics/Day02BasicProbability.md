**Question**

In a single toss of fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.

1. 2 / 3
2. 5 / 6 <-- **ANSWER**
3. 1 / 4
4. 1 / 6

**Explanation**

Each die has 6 sides, so the total number of possible outcomes is 6 x 6 = 36.

The possible sums over 9 are:

- Sum = 10: (4, 6), (6, 4), (5, 5)
- Sum = 11: (5, 6), (6, 5)
- Sum = 12: (6, 6)

Adding these up 3 + 2 + 1 = 6

Therefore the total number of possible outcomes which have sums equal or less than 9 are 36 - 6 = 30.

And, so the probability is 30 / 36 = **5 / 6**.
