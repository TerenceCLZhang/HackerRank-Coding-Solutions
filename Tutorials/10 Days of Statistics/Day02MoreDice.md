**Question**

In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.

1. 1 / 9 <-- **ANSWER**
2. 1 / 6
3. 2 / 3
4. 5 / 6

**Explanation**

There are a total of 36 possibile outcomes when rolling two dice.

There are six possible pairs where the sum equals to 6: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1)

If we exclude outcomes where the values are the same, we get 5 pairs, as we exclude (3, 3).

This means there are 4 favourable outcomes.

Therefore, the answer is 4 / 36 = **1 / 9**.
